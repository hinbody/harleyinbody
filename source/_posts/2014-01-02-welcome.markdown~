Welcome to my development blog. I am Harley and I will be your host. I am a
junior developer looking to make my way into the field full-time. I have an
A.A.S. in Computer Information Technology, and started to work on a B.S. in CS.
I am not currently attending school officially; but that doesn't mean that I'm
not still studying and learning. I have worked with C++ and PHP in the past, but
am currently working with Ruby. I have one Rails project that I've started
called [Bacon Splitter](http://bacon-splitter.herokuapp.com/ "Bacon Splitter").
Feel free to check it out and provide feedback if you have any. I'm also working
my way through the book "Rails 4 in Action" from
[Manning](http://www.manning.com/bigg2/), which has been a tremendous resource
for me. <!-- more --> 

I have wanted to start a dev blog for some time now, but the main impetus for me
starting this one now, comes from a few places. I've been inspired by 
[Joshua Kemp](https://twitter.com/Joshuakemp01) and his story of going from no
degree to a junior developer in less than a year. 
[Avdi Grimm](https://twitter.com/avdi) has mentioned that he like to read 
developer blogs, so I hoped to give him one more source to read. Also, 
[Mark Sim](https://twitter.com/marksim), one of my first remote pairing partners,
led me to Octopress as the framework to use. There are certainly other people 
who have both inspired me, and helped me learn; and I hope to give them the 
proper credit on this blog as we move forward.

I can be found on [Github](https://github.com/hinbody) and 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hinbody). Feel free to hit me up either place.
